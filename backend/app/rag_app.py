"""The shopping assistant's registration as an AOM **RAG Application**.

AOM's RAG Applications page lists registered apps (`/v1/rag/apps`) and
their activity: queries, LLM cache hits and Context Cache retrievals, all
attributed by the `rag:<app_id>:` namespace prefix.

The app is scoped to exactly one Knowledge Base document, today's Shopping
Guide, because a RAG query answers from whatever its role can read, and the
agent's role can also read every shopper profile the daily loader publishes.
Without the scope, a generic question from one shopper could retrieve
another shopper's profile. Shopper questions don't go through the app's
/query endpoint. The assistant builds those itself, with retrieval pinned to
the shopper's own profile document.

The guide document gets a new id every day, so the loader calls `sync()`
after each publish to point the app at the new one. `scripts/register_with_aom.py`
creates the app the first time.
